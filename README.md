# Pokemon HP Predictions

## Introduction
For our project, we worked on a Pokemon dataset that includes the type of Pokemon and their statistics. The objective of this 
project is to predict the Pokemon's HP based off of the given information. This project might be a bit challenging 
but definitely worth the struggle as we will be discovering new ways to identify a Pokemon's HP based on essential information. This project allows us 
to relive our childhood. If we are able to predict the Pokemon's HP based on the Attack, Defense, Sp. Atk, Sp. Def, Speed, and Generation we essentually become better "pokemon trainers" and eventually pokemon masters.

## Selection of Data

This project consists of the Pokemon.csv data set which includes **13 features**, with **800 samples**. The data set consists of columns pertaining to the 
Pokemon's statistics such as: Type, HP, Attack, Defense, etc. Some of the features that will be used as predictors are: _HP_, _Attack_, _Defense_, 
_Sp. Atk_, _Sp. Def_. 

After getting an idea of the data that we were working with, we decided to drop **Total** and **Type 2** as those features would not be needed 
in order to make our predictions. After dropping some features, the data that was left behind contained **3 categorical features**: _Name_, _Type 1_, and _Generation_ and **7 numerical features**: 
_#_, _HP_, _Attack_, _Defense_, _Sp. Atk_, _Sp. Def_, and _Speed_.

## Methods:
**Tools:**

- Numpy, Pandas, Matplotlib, and Seaborn for data analysis and visualization
- Scikit-learn for inference
- Github for code sharing and storing code
- Anaconda for Juypter Notebook (Converting visuals to PDF with better formatting)
- Google Colaboratory as IDE

**Inference Methods used with Scikit**
- Models: KNeighborsRegressor, LinearRegression, and PolynomialFeatures
